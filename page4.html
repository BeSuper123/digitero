                    <p>The Sims 4 is a social simulation game, similar to previous editions in the franchise.
                        The player is urged to make decisions and participate completely in an interactive 
                        environment since there is no overarching purpose or goal to pursue. The player is in 
                        charge of controlling the activities of the "Sims," responding to their "needs," and 
                        assisting them in fulfilling their goals. The game centers on the simulated lives of 
                        these virtual characters. <br><br>
                        It is a great game and I really recommend this game for people who like controlling game characters 
                        want to see how they make characters.

                        scrounge, and acquire items from a vast dynamic universe. You may construct shelters, 
                        spectacular moving vehicles and machines with the materials you've gathered to help 
                        you survive the perilous adventures that lie ahead. Join forces with friends or engage 
                        in combat with players and machines that seek to take your possessions.<br><br>
                        It is a great game and I really recommend this game for creative people who like

                    <h2>3. Animal Crossing</h2><img class="image" src="./Images/animalcrossing.jpg">
                    <p>Animal Crossing is a video game in which the player takes on the role of a human character 
                        who travels to a rural community populated by mythical creatures and remains there 
                        eternally. The gameplay is open-ended; there are no set goals; instead, players are
                        invited  to spend their time in the town engaging in any number of activities, such as 
                        gathering objects, cultivating plants, capturing insects, fishing, and mingling with the 
                        locals.<br><br>
                        It is a great game and I really recommend this game for creative people who want to play 
                        with others and have fun.

                    <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that gives players a lot of choice in how they choose to play 
                        because there are no set objectives to complete. The game's environment is made out of basic 
                        3D items, mostly cubes and liquids known as "blocks," that represent different types of 
                        substances including earth, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava.<br><br>
                        It is a great game and I really recommend this game for creative people who want a bit of a 
                        survival aspect.

                    <h2>5. Stardew Valley</h2><img class="image" src="./Images/stardewvalley.jpg">
                    <p>Stardew Valley is an agricultural simulation game based on the Tale of Seasons video game series. 
                        Players establish a character at the beginning of the game, who receives a plot of land and a 
                        little house that belonged to their grandpa in the small town of Pelican Town. Gamers can choose 
                        from a variety of farms, each having its own theme, advantages, and disadvantages. The countryside 
                        is initially covered with stones, trees, stumps, and weeds; players must labour to clear these in 
                        order to restart the farm. They must then tend to crops and cattle in order to earn money and 
                        further expand the farm's structures and amenities.<br><br>
                        It is a great game and I really recommend this game for people who like playing farm based games and like a good storyline.
